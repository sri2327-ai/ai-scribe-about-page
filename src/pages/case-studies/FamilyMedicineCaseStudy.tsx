          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Pain Points Before S10.AI Adoption</h2>
          <p>Before implementing S10.AI Medical Scribe, the individual practitioner encountered several challenges
             in medical documentation and administrative processes. Although they relied on ChatGPT for completing 
             documentation, it was still time-consuming to complete the documentation. The physician must type prompts
              into chatGPT, review the document, and manually enter it into the EHR. They realized it was 
              time-consuming and still a burden for the physician. They needed a more efficient tool to alleviate 
              the burden of manually pasting prompts and correcting inaccuracies. They expressed keen interest in 
              trying out the S10.AI Robot Medical Scribe to enhance their documentation workflow and compare it with 
              their existing solution.</p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Competitive Landscape</h2>
          <p>Before adopting S10.AI Medical Scribe, they used ChatGPT for documentation, which involved self-documentation.</p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Adoption History and Outcomes</h2>
          <p>S10.AI Robot Medical Scribe was implemented in a week. The notes were as per the physician's 
            documentation preference. The documentation was created directly from the conversation between the 
            physician and the patient. After adopting S10.AI Robot Medical Scribe, the practitioner reported a 
            significantly reduced documentation burden. They observed improvements in time efficiency, document quality, 
            and ease of use. S10.AI's capabilities helped streamline the documentation process, allowing the physician 
             focus more on patient care.</p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">The Unique Documentation Challenges of Functional Medicine</h2>
          <p>Vitality Advanced Medicine, a functional and longevity medical practice led by Dr. Sarah Williams, faced exceptional documentation challenges:</p>
          
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mt-4">
            <li>Complex patient histories often spanning decades of health concerns</li>
            <li>Extensive lab panels with hundreds of markers requiring interpretation</li>
            <li>Integration of conventional and alternative treatment approaches</li>
            <li>Detailed nutritional, lifestyle, and supplement recommendations</li>
            <li>Long patient visits (60-90 minutes) generating substantial documentation</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p className="mt-4">Before implementing CRUSH, Dr. Williams spent 2-3 hours each evening completing documentation, often working until 9 PM to finish notes from the day.</p>

        <section className="bg-blue-50 p-6 rounded-lg">
          <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Dr. Williams' Perspective</h2>
          <p className="italic">"Functional medicine requires a level of documentation detail that was nearly impossible to maintain without sacrificing my evenings and weekends. CRUSH has transformed our practice by not only handling the volume of information but actually enhancing how we organize and utilize it. The system understands our terminology, our approach to care, and our need for comprehensive documentation. I'm now able to focus more on patients during the day and actually have a life outside of work."</p>

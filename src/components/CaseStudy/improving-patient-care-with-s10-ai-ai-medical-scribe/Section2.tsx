      <Typography variant="h4">Introduction</Typography>
    <p>Electronic health records (EHRs) have become essential to modern healthcare, providing benefits such as 
      improved patient care, coordination, and data management. However, the increased use of EHRs has also 
      brought challenges, including the burden of clinical documentation on physicians and nurses. This case 
      study aims to conduct a scoping review to measure the clinical documentation burden among physicians and 
      nurses using EHRs, exploring the existing literature on this topic.</p>
</Stack>
<Stack spacing={2}>
     <Typography variant="h4">Methods</Typography>
     <p>A comprehensive literature search was conducted using electronic databases, including PubMed, Embase, 
      and CINAHL, to identify relevant studies published between 2010 and 2023. The search strategy included 
      keywords such as "clinical documentation burden," "physicians," "nurses," "electronic health records," 
      and variations thereof. Studies that measured the clinical documentation burden among physicians and nurses
       using EHRs, and reported quantitative or qualitative data related to this topic, were included in the 
       scoping review. </p>

      <Typography variant="h4">Challenges Faced by Physicians</Typography>
     
      <ul className={styles.list}>
      <li><strong>Increasing Documentation Burden:</strong>Physicians must document patient encounters thoroughly, including medical history, physical examination findings, diagnoses, treatment plans, and more. The increasing complexity of documentation requirements can take significant time and effort, reducing direct patient care.</li>
      <li><strong>Administrative Tasks: </strong>Physicians also face various administrative tasks, such as scheduling appointments, managing referrals, reviewing test results, and coordinating with other healthcare providers, which add to their workload. </li>
      <li><strong>Risk of Errors: </strong>The documentation process is prone to errors, such as missing or incomplete information, inaccurate coding, and transcription errors, which can compromise patient safety and lead to medical errors. </li>
      <li><strong>Burnout and Stress</strong>The heavy documentation burden, administrative tasks, long working hours, and high patient load contribute to physician burnout, negatively impacting their well-being and job satisfaction.</li>
      <li><strong>Limited Time for Direct Patient Care:</strong>The increasing demands of documentation and administrative tasks often leave physicians with insufficient time for direct patient care, leading to rushed encounters and compromised quality of care. </li>
      <li><strong>Complex Clinical Workflows:  </strong>Physicians work in complex clinical environments, requiring them to manage multiple tasks, including patient assessments, order entry, decision-making, and care coordination, while ensuring accurate documentation.</li>
      <li><strong>Compliance and Regulatory Requirements:</strong>Physicians need to comply with various regulatory requirements, such as documentation guidelines, coding standards, and privacy regulations, which add to the documentation burden. </li>
      <li><strong>Information Overload:  </strong> Physicians must process vast amounts of information, including patient medical history, laboratory results, radiology reports, and other data, which can be overwhelming and time-consuming. </li>
      <li><strong>Limited Work-Life Balance:</strong>The demanding nature of physician work often results in limited work-life balance, leading to stress, fatigue, and reduced job satisfaction. </li>
      <li><strong>Technological Challenges:</strong> EHRs and other digital health technologies can present challenges such as difficulties in navigating complex interfaces, interoperability issues, and time-consuming data entry. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>These challenges collectively contribute to the burden faced by physicians, reducing their ability to provide optimal patient care and negatively impacting their well-being. Addressing these challenges is crucial for improving patient care and physician satisfaction in the healthcare industry. </p>
